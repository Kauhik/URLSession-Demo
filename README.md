# URLSession Framework Overview

**URLSession** is Apple’s high-level networking API for making HTTP and HTTPS requests, handling data transfers, and managing background uploads and downloads — **without low-level socket code**.  
It’s part of the **Foundation** framework and provides a unified interface for creating and configuring network tasks.

With URLSession, you can easily add:
- **Data Tasks** – Fetch JSON or text-based resources and receive them as `Data` objects  
- **Download Tasks** – Download large files to disk with support for resumable transfers  
- **Upload Tasks** – Upload data or files using `URLRequest`, including multipart forms  
- **WebSocket Tasks** – Communicate over WebSocket for real-time, bidirectional messaging  
- **Background Sessions** – Run uploads/downloads in the background when your app is suspended  
- **Swift Concurrency** – Use `async/await` for simpler, more readable networking code  
- **HTTP/2 Support** – Automatically leverage HTTP/2 for faster performance  
- **Configurable Caching** – Use custom or default `URLSessionConfiguration` for caching and policies  
- **Task Prioritization** – Adjust priorities of requests via `URLSessionTask.priority`  
- **Security & Authentication** – Handle TLS, authentication, and secure delegate callbacks

## Human Interface Guidelines

While **URLSession** is a non-UI framework, when designing UIs that show network-fetched content (e.g., images, lists), follow the general HIG:

## Example App

**NetNewsWire** – A free iOS app that is a open-source RSS reader available on the App Store. 

It uses URLSession extensively to fetch RSS/Atom/JSON feeds, perform background updates, handle authentication challenges, and download media in a robust, user-friendly way.

## Summary

URLSession empowers you to handle most networking tasks — from simple fetches to background transfers and WebSocket connections — using a consistent, high-level API.  
It integrates deeply with Swift, making it a secure, performant, and future-ready solution across Apple platforms.
